## Heyo, Sirkorgo Here!
Sirkorgo is my shapeshifting fox OC. I like to use sirkorgo as my online persona, because why not? I'm obsessed with technology from the early 2000's and I find it fun to play and make games. Doodling's fun too, which is how I came up with sirkorgo! Along with a couple of my other OCs like Widget and Mono!

I love web, graphic, and game design!
(that's... a LOT of design...)

(this readme is a wip! almost done...)
