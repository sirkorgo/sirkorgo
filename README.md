### Heyo, I'm Sirkorgo!
Sirkorgo is my shapeshifting fox OC. I like to use sirkorgo as my online persona, because why not? I'm obsessed with technology from the early 2000's and I find it fun to play and make games. Doodling's fun too, which is how I came up with sirkorgo! Along with a couple of my other OCs like Widget and Mono!

I love web, graphic, and game design!
(that's... a LOT of design...)

I just find it fun to design UIs, and turn them into websites! Or with games, I LOVE coding.

Right now, I know how to use CSS and HTML, and a teensy bit of JavaScript. I'm hoping to learn more about JavaScript in the future, and hopefully learn some Python, too.
